# gql-simplified
Very simple NodeJS GraphQL boilerplate for quick MVP and medium-sized applications.

## Gameplan
By Mid-Apr 2018, workable boilerplate with basic code generators. This include accounts-password, accounts-metamask and basic unit tests.

By Mid-May 2018, workable boilerplate with database abstraction layer. Will support MongoDB for the start.

By Mid-June 2018, workable boilerplate with 3-server-cluster deployment script. Will support AWS with AWS default load balancer from the start. This also includes Docker image

No promise in the future beyond these 3 months as the end goal is to faster development process.

## Possible contributions
- Integration with CircleCI.

- Load testing framework.

- Integration with Apollo healthcheck app

- Integration with RethinkDB and MySQL.
